# VozAcessível - Chrome Extension

VozAcessível is a Chrome extension designed to help users with reading text from webpages. It reads the content aloud, providing accessibility support for people with visual impairments or other reading difficulties.

## Features

- Reads the page title when activated.
- Allows reading of text content by hovering the mouse over text elements such as paragraphs, links, etc.
- Works best with content in **Portuguese (Portugal)**.

## How it Works

1. Once activated, the extension will first read the title of the webpage.
2. After that, as you move your mouse over text elements on the page (such as paragraphs, links, etc.), the content will be read aloud.
3. Some websites may not work properly because of their structure, but we are continuously working to improve the experience.

**Note:** This extension is currently only available for **Portuguese (Portugal)**, as this is the only voice supported locally in the developer's setup. We apologize for this limitation!

## Installation

1. Download the extension files.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome browser.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files.

## Usage

1. Click on the extension icon in your browser.
2. Press the "Ler" button to start reading.
3. To stop the reading, click the "Parar de ler" button.
